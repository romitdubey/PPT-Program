When a feature value does not appear in the training data for a particular class, it results in zero probability for that class. Laplace smoothing addresses this issue by adding a small constant (usually 1) to both the numerator and denominator of the probability calculation. This ensures that even if a feature value is unseen in the training data, it still has a non-zero probability. Laplace smoothing helps prevent zero probabilities and improves the generalization ability of the Naive Approach."

    "Data drift refers to the phenomenon where the statistical properties of the data used for training a machine learning model change over time. It occurs when the distribution, relationships, or characteristics of the input data evolve in a way that the trained model becomes less accurate or less reliable. Data drift can arise due to various factors, such as changes in the data source, changes in the data generation process, or changes in the target population. Detecting and addressing data drift is crucial to maintaining model performance and ensuring the continued relevance and validity of the model."

    "Model performance: Data drift can significantly impact the performance of machine learning models.

Monitoring and detecting data drift allows for proactive maintenance of model performance.\n",

By detecting data drift, organizations can assess the ongoing validity of the model and take corrective actions, such as retraining the model or adjusting the decision boundaries.\n",

    "Decision-making: In real-world applications, decisions based on machine learning models can have critical consequences. If the model is making predictions on drifted data without detection, it can lead to incorrect decisions or actions. Data drift detection provides an opportunity to mitigate the risks associated with incorrect model outputs.\n",
